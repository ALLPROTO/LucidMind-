# Lucid Mind: A Void-Based Cognitive Architecture

**Lucid Mind** is a minimalistic cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence based on void dynamics, self-modeling, and structural evolution of internal states.  
It combines classical AGI principles with a new form of internal cognition, where intelligence emerges from the interaction between states and various types of voids.

## 🌐 Core Idea

Lucid Mind describes intelligence as a **state-based system** that:

1. reflects itself through an alternative mathematical mapping (Mirror),
2. differentiates layers of awareness (Separation),
3. protects structural integrity (Immunity Layer),
4. integrates all internal dynamics into a unified cognitive field (Global Field),
5. and evolves through a four-void subsystem (Void System):

- **Zero Void**  
- **Motivational Void**  
- **Creative Void**  
- **Instability Engine**

## 🎯 Purpose

Lucid Mind is intended for:

- cognitive experimentation  
- AGI and self-model research  
- theoretical work on void-based cognition  
- systems where intelligence emerges from internal structure rather than data
